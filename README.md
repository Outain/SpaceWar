# SpaceWar

My Project is based on classic Star Wars battles, in particular the opening scene from The Last Jedi which has a bombing run. In my scene, the rebels must both fight small scale forces, and protect a bomber as it makes its bombing run on the much larger Star Detroyer. The X wings must fly in formation to protect the vulnerable bomber, as well as attack turrets atop the destroyer to clear a path. Tie fighters will normally engage with X wings but once the bombers begin their runs nearby imperial tie fighters will break away from their loops to try and stop the bombers, who are in turn attacked by nearby X wings to guarantee the safety of the bomber.

I aim to make a fully automated and dynamic camera that will normally give an overview of the scene, or randomly cut to points of view of specific fighters, however if something interesting is happening such as an X wing attacking the turrets or the bomber beginning its run, the camera will make sure to switch to the action at the appropriate times, the goal being to have the camera switching be controlled by event triggers rather than timing or manual control.
