# Description of the assignment
My Project is based on classic Star Wars battles, in particular the opening scene from The Last Jedi which has a bombing run. In my scene, the rebels must both fight small scale forces, and protect a bomber as it makes its bombing run on the much larger Star Detroyer. The X wings must fly in formation to protect the vulnerable bomber, which will drop bombs on the destroyer as it passes by. Eventually the bomber drops enough bombs and the destroyer goes down.

# How it works
The scene uses path following, seek and offset pursue from the scripts given in class. I added my own scripts for firing lasers using raycasting and coroutines so that the lasers would fire in bursts. I added another script for the bomber so it would drop a bomb once it passes through the collider of the Star Destroyer. The Cameras are set up to activate and deactivate based on a coroutine.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I'm most proud of the use of editing and camera work in this assignment. I tried to edit the clips so they would flow and create a good sense of pacing throughout.
